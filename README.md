# RISK-V-a-Learning-Journey-for-High-Schoolers
This repository explores how a C program transforms into hardware through RISC-V, ISA, RTL, and related concepts. We start from the basics and gradually dive deeper to understand every layer of the RISC-V ecosystem, from software instructions to actual processor execution.
## Introduction to RISC-V
RISC-V RISC-V stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer, it has small and simple instructions which makes hardware design easier to implement it is an Open source Instruction Set Architecutre (ISA) used for designing the computers.
ISA ISA as we previously saw stands for Instruction Set Architecture it defines the instructions the porcessor understands and how it manipulates the data. It is the language of the computer and they way we'll talk to the computer. ISA acts asa bridge between the software and the hardware and makes it easier to communicate between these two. It tells us -
• What Instructions Exist
• How to format them
• How a CPU should execute them
